# Developed by Logan Rower
# Field Trap Script
# Use the Flags to allow the user to run a different version of the script

"""
This Script is to be used for the HQ Camera 

Also the file names a preset to be labelled as Pi3, so this will need to be changed to the corresponding Pi# based on each 
individual Pi

Pi1

Flags:

'-t' -> Shows and saves a test image 

'-r' -> Runs the timelapse based on json parameters

This is the initial implementation with ZERO SOCKET 

Updated Version: 7/18/2022


FOR EACH PI ADD THE PI NUMBER TO THE FILENAME...
