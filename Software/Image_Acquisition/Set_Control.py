This python script is to be run on the ubuntu machine that will be acting as the main server.
In order to appropriately sync the pies so that they are all communicating at the same time the user needs to run this script
before starting the experiment. This will allow for the following parameters to be changed after this control file is sent to all the 
pi devices.

dictionary to json...

PARAMETERS:
- start time
- duration of experiment
- frame rate
(brightness, contrast...) -> more to be and can be added for greater control
